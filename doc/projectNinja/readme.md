# Project Ninja System

The project Ninja is a centralized controlled distributed cyber attack launching system.

The idea of the name comes from a Japanese comic book "Naruto", this project provides groups of  different kind of centralized controlled Ninja (malware) to launching cyber attack to the target. Why we call our software this name and what 's the main feature ? 

1. In the Ninja world, every ninja has basic skill such as infiltrate and some specialty skill such as collect information or assassinate. In our system all the Ninja malwares inherited from the basic Ninja malwares which have the basic malicious action such as run cmd, steal files, inject malware on the victim, and the Ninja malware will be integrated with special malicious action module for the specific tasks such as do the Modbus-FDI, MITM attack, ARP spoofing, break the system. 
2. In Each Ninja village, there is one leader to assign task to all the other Ninja who is called the shadow. In our system, the hacker is the shadow, with a centralized controlled RTC2 system the hacker can "post" the task to any of the "Ninjia" on the dashboard (RTC2 system), the Ninja (malware) will pull his task from the dashboard and report the task execution result on dashboard. All the communication is encrypted, the "shadow" can assign the task from any place in the internet, the hack will not communicate with the malware directly, even the defender trace the communication, he can only find the dashboard. 
3. The Ninja has different kinds of weapon, we provide a dynamic attack action repo which can plug in the Ninja to run in real time. The hacker can attach the attack module with the task on the dashboard, when the Ninja get the task, it will also equip the attack module to do the specific attack task. (For example a spytrojan Ninja, its basic function is collect the credentials from the victim, but if the hacker assign the False Data Injection task to it, it will download the network scan nodule and FDI module and do the FDI attacker)
4. The Ninja will clear the trace after it finished the task, there is no code based task line all the task are save the in the memory. For example a Ninja got 4 tasks to break a system, when the defender detected error and "catch" the Ninja program, from the memory dump he will not able to the tasks list from program or from the memory dump. 
5. Fight with the defender: each Ninja will bind with a Ninja-dog (program protection watch dog), if the Ninja malware is killed/deleted by the anti malware program, the Ninja-dog will recover the Ninja automatically. at the same time if a Ninja detected is start by a Ninja-dog, it will start a sub process to active the self protection feature: lock the victim's mouse+keyboard input, freeze screen and start to use garbage to full fill the memory to drag down the system.

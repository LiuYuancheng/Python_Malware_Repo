# Man in the Middle Attacker 

**Program design purpose** : We want to create a Man in the Middle Attacker which can be integrated in our C2 Emulation system to use the comprehensive suite software [Ettercap](https://www.ettercap-project.org/) to implement the Man in the Middle attack to reverse the byte data in the OT system HMI-PLC Modbus control channel. This program will be used for the [Cross Sword 2023 Cyber Exercise](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/natoccdcoe_crossedswords-activity-7140986334961217536-7dM5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) test run Railway OT system attack demo.

### Introduction 

The Man-in-the-Middle attack scenario is a more complex APR attack case which based on a successful ARP spoofing attack. For the ARP spoofing attack please refer to the [ARP Spoofing Attacker [Packet Drop] doc](readme.md)

A man in the middle (MITM) attack is a general term for when a perpetrator positions himself in a conversation between two peers such as a user and an applicationâ€”either to eavesdrop or to impersonate one of the parties, making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is underway.

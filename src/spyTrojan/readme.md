# SpyTrojan Emulator

**Program design purpose :** We want to create a spy trojan emulation program wich can be integreated in our C2 Emulation system, so one/multiple red team hackres can remote monitor user's action (logging keyboard event, take screen shot) and do same malicious action (run commands, inject other malware, scan the network, ssh to other victim) on multiple victim host. This program will be used for the Lock Shield 2024 Cyber Exercise DFIR(digital forensics and incident response) section.

### Introduction 

This Spy Trojan is inherted from the [C2 Emulation system](https://github.com/LiuYuancheng/Python_Malwares_Repo/tree/main/src/c2Emulator) standard backdoor trojan example `<backdoorTrojan.py>` and added the below special function:

- Keyboard event logging and user keyboard type in simulation from User Emulator Project `keyEventActor.py`  [source code](https://github.com/LiuYuancheng/Windows_User_Simulator/blob/main/src/actionScheduler/UtilsFunc/keyEventActors.py)
- Network Scanning function from User Emulator Project lib `nmapUtils.py` [source code](https://github.com/LiuYuancheng/Windows_User_Simulator/blob/main/src/lib/nmapUtils.py)
- SSH login and run cmd and SCP file copy from SSHconnecor lib [project link](https://github.com/LiuYuancheng/SSH-connector)
- User desktop screen shot function. 

The red team hacker will use the User Emulator Profile to simulate one/multiple hackers give different intruction to 4 malware which running in 4 victim to do different malicious action at different time. All the action are driven by the hacker's profile.

#### Background knowledge

Different between backdoor Trojan and Spy Trojan: 

Backdoor Trojans and Spy Trojans are both types of Trojan horses, which are malicious software that disguises itself as legitimate or benign to deceive users into executing them. However, they serve different purposes and have distinct functionalities:

##### Backdoor Trojan

- **Functionality:** A Backdoor Trojan, as the name suggests, creates a secret entry point (backdoor) into the infected system, allowing unauthorized access and control.
- **Objective:** The primary goal of a Backdoor Trojan is to provide remote access to the attacker, enabling them to perform various malicious activities without the user's knowledge.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Opening a network port for communication.
  - Uploading and downloading files.
  - Executing commands remotely.
  - Installing additional malware.
- **Risk:** Backdoor Trojans pose a significant security risk as they can give attackers persistent access to the compromised system, leading to data theft, system manipulation, or further exploitation.

##### Spy Trojan

- **Functionality:** A Spy Trojan is designed to monitor and collect sensitive information from the infected system without the user's awareness.
- **Objective:** The primary goal of a Spy Trojan is to steal valuable data, such as login credentials, personal information, financial details, or other sensitive data.
- Capabilities:
  - Keylogging: Recording keystrokes to capture passwords and other text input.
  - Screen capture: Taking screenshots to capture sensitive information displayed on the screen.
  - Clipboard capture: Collecting data copied to the clipboard.
  - Webcam or microphone surveillance: Monitoring audio and video inputs.
- **Risk:** Spy Trojans are a significant privacy and security threat as they can lead to identity theft, unauthorized access to accounts, or the compromise of confidential information.

### Program Setup

Development/Execution Environment : python 3.7.4+

Additional Lib/Software Need : 

- keyboard 0.13.5 : https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/
- pyscreenshot 3.1 : https://pypi.org/project/pyscreenshot/



------

### Program Usage 

Set the config file base on your RTC2 server (rename the `spyTrojanCfg_template.txt` to `spyTrojanCfg.txt` ): 

Run the spy trojan to connect to the RTC2 server: 

```
python falsecmdinjector.py
```

Check whether the false data injector registered on C2:

##### 1.Run command on victim machine 

Refer to RTC2 Emulation system document section [Assign Command Execution Task to Malicious-Action-Program](https://github.com/LiuYuancheng/Python_Malwares_Repo/blob/main/src/c2Emulator/readme.md)



##### 2.Steal a cretical file from victim machine

Refer to RTC2 Emulation Sysetm document section [Copy File From the Victim Machine to RTC2-Hub](https://github.com/LiuYuancheng/Python_Malwares_Repo/blob/main/src/c2Emulator/readme.md)



##### 3.Inject another malware/file to the victim machine 

Refer to RTC2 Emulation Sysetm document section [Inject file from C2 to target victim machine ]((https://github.com/LiuYuancheng/Python_Malwares_Repo/blob/main/src/c2Emulator/readme.md)



##### 4.Scan the victim subnet to find all the host IP addresses

Select the false Modbus data injector page, then select the **Assign a special task via Json**, then fill in the task detail : 

- TaskType: `scanSubnet`
- Repeat: `int <number of the injection repeat times>`
- Tasks data: `<subnet string> example:172.25.121.0/24 `

Assign task from Web-UI

![](img/func4_scanSubnet.png)

After the task executed (state change to finsih) , click the show task result to list all the IP addresses in the subnet 

- **Via HTTP POST request** : 

```
http://<RTC2-Hub ip address >:<port>/addnewtask, json={"malwareID": <ID>, "taskType": "scanSubnet", "taskdata": <task detail infomration json data> }

Example: 
requests.get(http://127.0.0.1:5000/addnewtask, json={"malwareID':"spyTrojan01","taskType":"scanSubnet","taskdata":"172.25.121.0/24" })

```



5.Scan the victim subnet to find all the host IP addresses

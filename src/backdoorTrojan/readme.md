1. **Education** at any level of cyber security course about trojan and system laboratory assignment / demo. 
2. **Training** for company employees, semi-professionals trojan attack and defense  workshop. 
3. **Development or cluster management** for cluster admin to remote manage cloud computing infra (with out using credentials ).

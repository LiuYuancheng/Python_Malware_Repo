# Command and Control(C2) Emulator

Design Purpose: 

  We want to design a C2 malware management system which can be apply for the 

  cyber execise used by red team: 

  \- CIdex2022

  \- LS2022

  \- XS2023



  All the Malicious action protram / malware will report C2 via http/https, it 

  will provide the web interface or API for red team user / program to do the 

  control of the linked malwares. To automate the malware action timeline, if you 

  don't want to hard code the timeline in the malware, you can : 

1. Set the malware task config json file, then upload to C2, then the C2 will 

​    auto-assign the task to the malware. 

2. Use one User emulator to simulate a hacker's attack time line and call the 

​    related C2's API to dynamically control the related malware.

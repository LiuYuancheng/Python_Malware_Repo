# Red Team C2 Hub Emulator

**Project Design Purpose** : 

Red Team Command and Control (C2) server, also known as a C&C server, is a centralized server or a set of servers that used by red team in cyber exercise / range to  control and communicate with compromised systems, often referred to as bots or zombies. The C2 server serves as the command center, allowing attackers to send instructions to the infected machines, receive data from them, and coordinate malicious activities. We want to provide a general C2 server emulation solution which allow cyber exercise red team members can hook different kind of Probing program / Malicious action program and dynamically monitor, schedule and control these program. It can by apply on below field : 

- Cyber exercise red teaming :  Used by red team to control the other DDoS Attacker, Data Theft program, phishing data generator.
- Forensic traffic research : used to simulate / repeat the attack scenario for C2 detection research and forensic analyze. 

 









  We want to design a C2 malware management system which can be apply for the 

  cyber execise used by red team: 

  \- CIdex2022

  \- LS2022

  \- XS2023



  All the Malicious action protram / malware will report C2 via http/https, it 

  will provide the web interface or API for red team user / program to do the 

  control of the linked malwares. To automate the malware action timeline, if you 

  don't want to hard code the timeline in the malware, you can : 

1. Set the malware task config json file, then upload to C2, then the C2 will 

​    auto-assign the task to the malware. 

2. Use one User emulator to simulate a hacker's attack time line and call the 

​    related C2's API to dynamically control the related malware.

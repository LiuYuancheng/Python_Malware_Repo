# Python Program Obfuscator

![](doc/img/logo_normal.png)

**Program design Purpose** : We want to create a python program obfuscation tool which can easily obfuscate encode the source code (whole file or section of the code)  to be a bytes type executable python section for people who want to protect their intellectual property rights, or are running Python services with sensitive source code. It will also provide the decoder to convert the obfuscated bytes data back to the source code.

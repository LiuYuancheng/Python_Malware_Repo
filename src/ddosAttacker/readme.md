## DDoS Attack Emulation System

The distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. It is a very common and simple attack vector which hacker will use to compromise a web / network service. We want to create a multi-thread service / App layer DDoS Attack emulation system for user which can parallel generate hundreds of network request (such as ssh, http get/post, udp, tcp, modbus ) at same time and send to one target. The DDoS attack manager can be applied for below purpose : 

1. **Education and Training** : used for any level of cyber security course about DDoS attack or the related course lab assignment / demo. 
2. **Stress testing or penetration test : **Used for different kind of network service. 
3. **Attack simulation** : used for red team to launch DDoS attack in cyber exercise. 
4. **Research** : used for DDoS attack research such as attack identify, detection and defense.

### Introduction 

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as [IoT devices](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-of-things-iot/). We want to create a distributed DDoS attack launch system which contents :

1. One **DDoS attacker** program running on single nodes with a attack thread pool to start several hundreds of parallel threads to implement the attack at the same time based on user config. 
2. One **DDoS attack actors** repo contents different kinds of attack actor to send different kinds of network request (such ssh, https-GET, https-POST, SMB login...) to the target. Each attack actor object will be assembled in a attack thread and put in to the attack pool of the DDoS attacker. 
3. One **DDos control hub** to link all the DDoS attackers together so the user can monitor the current attack state and control each DDoS attack via the hub's web interface.

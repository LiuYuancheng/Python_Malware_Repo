## DDoS Attack Emulation System

The distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. It is a very common and simple attack vector which hacker will use to compromise a web / network service. We want to create a multi-thread service / App layer DDoS Attack emulation system for user which can parallel generate hundreds of network request (such as ssh, http get/post, udp, tcp, modbus ) at same time and send to one target. The DDoS attack manager can be applied for below purpose : 

1. **Education and Training** : used for any level of cyber security course about DDoS attack or the related course lab assignment / demo. 
2. **Stress testing or penetration test : **Used for different kind of network service. 
3. **Attack simulation** : used for red team to launch DDoS attack in cyber exercise. 
4. **Research** : used for DDoS attack research such as attack identify, detection and defense.

### Introduction 

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as [IoT devices](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-of-things-iot/).

# Python Process Watchdog 

![](logo.png)

Design Purpose : During the cyber exercise we found as a red team, the injected malware or attack launching program can easy be stopped by the blue team by kill the process / delete the file. We want to create a watchdog program which can bind to the target-program then monitor and protect the target-program's execution state : 

- If the targe program is close/killed , restart a new individual process to run the program.
- If the target program is deleted, recover the program from backup and run the program. 

The watchdog can not only used in the cyber exercise red teaming but also in the field of protecting the normal service program (to avoid people killed the service accidently), research of malware action detection.

### Introduction 

A watchdog in the context of computer programs typically refers to a mechanism or a piece of software designed to monitor the execution of another program or system and take action if it detects certain issues or anomalies. The purpose of a watchdog is to ensure the continued and reliable operation of the monitored system.

Here's how a typical watchdog mechanism works:

1. **Monitoring:**
   - The watchdog monitors the behavior or status of a specific program or system.
2. **Timeouts:**
   - The watchdog sets predefined timeouts. If the monitored program/system doesn't report back or complete a specific task within the expected timeframe, the watchdog assumes that something might be wrong.
3. **Action:**
   - When a timeout or an issue is detected, the watchdog takes predefined actions. These actions can include restarting the monitored program, triggering an alarm, logging the issue for analysis, or even shutting down the entire system to prevent further damage.
4. **Health Checking:**
   - In addition to timeouts, watchdogs may perform health checks on the monitored system. If the system's health falls below a certain threshold, the watchdog can trigger corrective actions.

Watchdogs are commonly used in embedded systems, critical infrastructure, servers, and other environments where continuous operation is crucial. They help prevent issues like software freezes, crashes, or other unexpected failures from causing prolonged downtime.

The term "watchdog" can also be used metaphorically in programming to refer to any mechanism that ensures the health and stability of a system, not necessarily through timeouts but through continuous monitoring and appropriate responses to anomalies.

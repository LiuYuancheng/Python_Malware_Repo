# Python_Malware_Repo
We want to create a repository which can provide different "Malwares" (or program which can simulate the malware's action ) which are written by Python, the malwares will content phishing email generator, backdoor trojan, screen freezer, key logger, malware process watchdog protector, DDoS attacker, traffic data blocker / replacer , password cracker and so on for below purposes :

1. **Education** for any level of cyber security course about malware / program harmful action or the related course lab assignment / demo. 
2. **Training** for company employees, semi-professionals such as the workshop about the cyber attack and defense. 
3. **Development or cluster management** for cluster admin to remote manage cloud computing infra (with out using credentials ) such as do program hot update or software deployment.
4. **Testing** for the security solution program / malware detection program to detect the malware.
5. **Research** in cluster network unusual/exception traffic detection, trojan detection, risk respond,  penetration action detection.

### Introduction 

Most the malwares in this repository are implemented by python and C, some program need to work together with attack tool / software. The cyber attack vectors and the malicious action we provide are : 

| Attack Vector                 | Malicious action                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Compromised Credentials       | File stolen, critical data leakage, history scanning, keyboard input logging, screen capture, browser cookie archiving. |
| Weak Credentials              | Password dictionary crack attack ( zip file )                |
| Phishing                      | Phishing email generator, scam email generator.              |
| Brute Force                   | Web login brute force crack, account takeover.               |
| Distributed Denial of Service | DDoS attack on web, OT-system(PLC), different service such as email server. |
| Trojans                       | Backdoor trojan                                              |
| Man-in-the-Middle Attacks     | Arp spoofing , packets drop, packets data replace.           |
| Insider threats               | Malware camouflage, trojan inject, device I/O Compromise (mouse, keyboard, screen frozen) |



The malware programs currently we provide are : 

1. **Backdoor Trojan system**  : A backdoor trojan system which contents a watch dog protected backdoor trojan, a peer to peer single trojan controller and a multiple trojans control hub system.

### Malware Detail



#### Backdoor Trojan

- The Trojan system contents 3 main programs:

  1. One **Backdoor Trojan** program running on victim open a backdoor to allow hacker to remote run commands, steal credential files, do harmful action to the host computer or  insert other malware into a host without authorization. 
  2. One **P2P Trojan Connector**  which is a console based peer to peer direct trojan remote connector for hacker used to remote control one of the backdoor trojan to do the harmful action such as rename all user's file, full fill user's home folder with garbage files. It allows multiple hackers to control one trojan at the same time. 
  3. One **Trojans Controller Hub** which is a UI based trojan management hub used for hacker to manage multiple trojan in different victim host or batch launch attack such as clear all files in every victim computer's home folder. It allows one hacker control multiple trojans at the same time.

The workflow between the backdoor trojan and trojan controller is shown below:
